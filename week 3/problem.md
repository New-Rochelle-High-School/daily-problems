# Power(x, y)

Given float (or double) x and float (or double) y, return x to the y power.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as pow(x, y) or x ** y.

## Example 1

```md
Input: x = 4.4, y = 3
Output: 85.184
```

## Example 2

```md
Input: x = 2.72, y = 3.14
Output: 23.14975284345994...
```

## Constraints

```md
0 <= x <= 2 ^ 31 - 1
0 <= y <= 2 ^ 31 - 1
```
